      "title": "The Journey Begins - Evaporation", 
      "objective": "Understand how water transforms from liquid to vapor and rises into the atmosphere",
      "content": "When the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, it turns into invisible water vapor that rises up into the sky. This is called evaporation! Just like when you see steam rising from a hot cup of tea, water changes from liquid to gas when it gets warm enough. The warmer it gets, the faster water evaporates.",

      "objective": "Learn how water vapor cools and forms clouds in the atmosphere", 
      "content": "High up in the sky, the water vapor gets cold and turns back into tiny water droplets. These droplets stick to dust particles in the air and form clouds! This process is called condensation - the opposite of evaporation. You can see condensation on a cold glass on a hot day.",

      "objective": "Discover how water returns to Earth as rain, snow, or hail",
      "content": "When the water droplets in clouds get too heavy, they fall back down to Earth! This can happen as rain, snow, sleet, or even hail, depending on how cold it is. This falling water is called precipitation. The water then flows into rivers and oceans, and the cycle starts all over again!",
